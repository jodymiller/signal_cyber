#Defensive Security Projects

A work in progress, but some experimentation in the following:

**Wazuh + Snort on Linux**
Setup:
* Wazuh installed on main physical machine along with Snort
* Wazuh running through Docker
* Second physical Linux machine with 2 Linux virtual machines also set up to send logs

Learnings:
* Simulation closer to an enterprise environment structure with multiple separate machine configuration
* Learning Wazuh rules and how they apply
* Remediation of rule violations to increase compliance scores
* Deeper learning of some aspects of Linux system administration through flagged items
