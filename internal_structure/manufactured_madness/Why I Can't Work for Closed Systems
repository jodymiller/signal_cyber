Why I Can't Work for Closed Systems

What is a closed system?
The definition depends on the context, but the gist is similar. Here are a couple different definitions:
1. Social classes
- Caste system where what you are at birth is where you stay in the hierarchy (closed) vs. achievement based ability to move through hierarchy (open)
2. Thermodynamic
- 
3. Workplaces
